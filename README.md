# Arduino-Uno
Arduino Uno Submission


My project for using the Arduino Uno wifi would be attached to one or more air quality sensors (ie. particle sensor and others). The Ariduino would be linked to a progam or app (written in Processing) that sends the data collected by the Arduino which the program can analyze the data, interpret it and display the results to the user. This project will allow users to get to know what the air quality surrounding them.
