# Arduino-Uno
Arduino Uno Submission
My project using the Arduino Uno wifi would be to attach a air quality sensor(s) (ie. particle sensor and the like) to the Aridunio that links to a progam or app (most likely written in Processing) that can interpret the data sent from the Uno WIfi to let the user know the air quality that the user is breathing in.
